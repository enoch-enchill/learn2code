                    <span id="backend-motto-body">
                        <p>The College motto in Latin is &ldquo;Omnia Vincit Labor&rdquo; which means, ‘Perseverance conquers all&rsquo; in English. The origin of the motto is ascribed to Archbishop William T. Porter, who declared in a statement made during the official opening ceremony of the College on 22nd January 1936:</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Labour Overcometh all things&rdquo; is the motto chosen for this School, and to this day is the splendid triumph for the labour and sacrifices of our predecessors. It is a fitting motto and a noble ideal to set before the citizens of any country: It represents the position, the mind and the determination of Gold Coast Catholics today. Their example will be an inspiration to their children, and I trust that it will be the ideal set before the students who in future years will pass through this school, and afterwards will take their places as responsible citizens in their country.&rdquo; Rev. Fr. Maurice B. Kelly, a founding member and the first Headmaster of the College, saw in this statement a good maxim to be adopted as the College&rsquo;s motto. He therefore summarised the statement in Latin as ‘Omnia Vincit Labor.&rsquo;</p>

                    <h3 id="backend-colours-title">College Flag and Colours</h3>
                    <span id="backend-colours-body">
                        <p>Being Irish, the founding fathers, carved out the colours of the College flag from their country&rsquo;s national flag, which has green to the left and orange to the right with white in the middle.</p>
                        <p>The green represents the Catholic population of Ireland and the orange, the protestants population. The white symbolizes the growing desire for peace between the two dominant religious groups, since the nationalist struggle in 1848.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, the green in the College Flag signifies the Catholic identity of the College. The white symbolizes the College&rsquo;s invitation to other institutions of learning to co-exist and share in its rich experience. The flag is hoisted with the green on top, which shows the Catholic identity of the College soaring above all. The white below shows the College&rsquo;s readiness to co-exist with all other institutions of learning that relate with it.</p>

                    <h3 id="backend-emblem-title">College Emblem</h3>
                    <span id="backend-emblem-body">
                        <p>The College emblem consists of a shield on which is a white cross on a green field. In the grand old days of medieval chivalry, when brave Knights went forth to do battle for the Holy Places and returned victorious, they had their shields emblazoned with the white cross.</p>
                        <p>In the same vein, it is our hope that when teachers and students go forth to do battle against the forces of ignorance and superstition and emerge victorious, the white cross of purity will be emblazoned on their hearts.</p>
                        <p>Superimposed on the white cross is a lighted torch, flanked by a laurel that is represented by yellow olive branches. The lighted torch is symbolic of the College&rsquo;s shining leadership in academic excellence and progress. The laurel represents the reward of victory awaiting every Augustinian who nobly applies himself to his role in life.</p>
                        <p>The green background represents the fertility of the College&rsquo;s ongoing desire and pursuance for developing holistic students&mdash;students of excellence in both academic and moral upbringing.</p>
                        <p>The grey colour on the upper part of the shield&mdash;a combination of white and black&mdash;signifies the combined efforts of the white Society of African Missionaries (SMA) Fathers and the African faithful in propagating the gospel through the promotion of excellent academic and moral discipline. Their aim was to produce a perfect Christian and thus a perfect citizen.</p>
